## Day 6

Seems this series of videos could only be a better to have. Going to turn to algorithm and leave these videos to train time. Turn to hello-algo suggested by Bilibili. https://github.com/krahets/hello-algo.  
The next plan might be https://github.com/krahets/LeetCode-Book.  
Read through the introduction and 'iteration and recursion'. Begin with 'time complexity' next time.  

## Day 7

Time/Space Complexity. Part of basic data structure. Part of number encode.
